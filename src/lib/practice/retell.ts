 * listening allows longer speaking, up to 2 minutes (see `speakLimit`).
 * Key points are written with the piece, so feedback checks the retelling

He thought clients would be unhappy and the team would not finish their work on time. After six months, the results surprised him. People took fewer sick days, and they were more focused during the week. Instead of long meetings, the team had a short fifteen-minute meeting every morning. They also agreed to check their email only twice a day, so they had more time for real work. Not everything was easy. Some clients wanted answers on Fridays, so the team took turns being available by phone. One designer said the extra day off had changed her life: she started painting again and spent more time with her children. The company has now decided to keep the four-day week, and two other local businesses have asked Tom for advice.',

		text: 'Ten years ago, the centre of the small town of Harwick was almost empty in the evenings. Most shops closed at half past five, and people drove to a big shopping centre outside town instead. A local baker called Priya Shah decided to do something about it. Her idea was simple: a market that opened only at night, once a week, in the old car park behind the town hall. She asked ten friends who made food, jewellery and furniture to join her. On the first night, it rained heavily, and only about fifty people came. Priya almost gave up. But the people who came told their friends. By the end of the first summer, more than a thousand visitors were coming every Thursday, and the market had grown from ten stalls to sixty. There was live music, and local schools sold things their students had made. The market also changed the town in ways nobody expected. Cafés and restaurants nearby started staying open later, and three new shops opened on the main street. The town council, which had not helped at first, began paying for better lights and extra rubbish bins. There were problems too. Some people who lived near the car park complained about the noise and the parking. Priya met them and agreed to finish the music at nine o’clock and to ask visitors to park at the train station. After that, most of the complaints stopped. Today the market is run by a small team of volunteers, and Priya spends more time in her bakery again. She says the best thing about the market is not the money it brings to the town. It is that people who have lived on the same street for years finally know each other’s names.',
