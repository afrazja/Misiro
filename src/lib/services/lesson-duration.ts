/**
 * How long a lesson actually takes, derived from what is in it.
 *
 * The dashboard used to print a hardcoded "~5–10 minutes" on every lesson,
 * A1 and B1 alike. The number is a promise about effort, so it has to come
 * from the content — add two paragraphs and it should move by itself,
 * without anyone remembering to edit a field.
 *
 * The per-item costs are calibrated against the seeded content: a lesson of
 * 10.8 sentences split evenly sent/received plus one grammar moment comes out
 * at ~7 minutes, which matches what those lessons really are. They are still
 * estimates — recordLessonDuration() logs the real thing so they can be
 * corrected from data rather than argued about.
 *
 * Pure functions on plain counts: no storage, no clock, no DOM.
